# Train-Scheduler

Train Sceduler is a applicatiln that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Information is retrieved and manipulated with Moment.js. The website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arribal times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

HOW IT WORKS

The user inputs the name of the train, destination, first time the train arrives and the frequency at which it arrives. After selecting Submit the train will be added to Firebase and the table will be updated. Moment.js will be used to calculate when the tran will arrive next and how many minute away it is.
